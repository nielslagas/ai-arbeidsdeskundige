# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus has been on implementing the frontend UI development (Fase 3) and integrating it with the backend API. The backend implementation for Fase 2 (Document Handling & RAG Pipeline) is complete, including the integration of OpenRouter for report generation.

## Recent Changes
- Modified `backend/routers/reports.py` to use OpenRouter via the OpenAI Python SDK for report generation, replacing the previous Google Gemini integration.
- Added `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to the `.env` file.
- Fixed an `ImportError` in `backend/main.py` by removing the unnecessary import and usage of `create_db_and_tables`.
- Confirmed that the backend server starts successfully with the OpenRouter integration.
- Implemented the frontend UI and logic for:
    - User authentication flow (registration, login, session management, route protection).
    - Case management (listing, creating, viewing details).
    - Document handling (uploading documents for a case).
    - RAG functionality (providing prompts, triggering search).
    - Report generation (triggering report generation, viewing results).
    - Displaying asynchronous task status for document processing (periodic polling in CaseDetails.vue).
- Updated frontend components (`DocumentUploadForm.vue`, `DocumentSearch.vue`, `ReportGenerator.vue`, `CaseDetails.vue`, `CaseList.vue`, `CreateCaseForm.vue`) to interact with the backend API endpoints.
- Added periodic polling in `CaseDetails.vue` to update document statuses.

## Next Steps
The core frontend UI for Fase 3 is now complete. The next steps involve:
- Testing the integrated frontend and backend functionalities end-to-end.
- Addressing any bugs or issues found during testing.
- Refining the UI/UX based on testing and feedback.
- Transitioning to Fase 4: Advanced Features & Refinements.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The backend now uses OpenRouter with the `openrouter/auto` model for report generation.
- The Supabase RPC `generate_embedding` is still used for generating embeddings for document chunks and user prompts.
- Frontend development used Vue.js as established in `techContext.md`.
- Periodic polling is implemented in `CaseDetails.vue` to update document statuses.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Continued use of FastAPI, SQLModel, Supabase, Celery, and Redis for the backend.
- Adhering to the established project structure.
- Using Vue.js for the frontend with Vue Router for navigation.
- Integrating frontend with backend via REST API calls, including handling authentication headers.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Successfully integrated OpenRouter as an alternative LLM provider using the OpenAI Python SDK.
- Resolved backend startup issues related to database initialization logic.
- Successfully implemented the core frontend UI and integrated it with the backend API, completing Fase 3.
- Implemented periodic polling as a mechanism to display asynchronous task status on the frontend.
