# Progress

## What Works
- Backend core infrastructure (FastAPI, SQLModel, Supabase connection, Celery/Redis setup).
- User authentication endpoints (registration, login, protected route).
- Case management endpoints (create, list, get).
- Document upload endpoint and storage in Supabase.
- Celery worker task for asynchronous document processing.
- Document parsing for `.docx` and `.txt` files in the worker.
- Paragraph-based document chunking in the worker.
- Calling Supabase RPC `generate_embedding` for chunk and prompt embeddings.
- Vector search endpoint using raw SQL with pgvector.
- Report generation endpoint integrating OpenRouter (via OpenAI SDK) and using vector search results as context.
- Backend server starts successfully with the current configuration.
- Frontend user authentication interface (registration, login, session management, route protection).
- Frontend case listing and creation interface.
- Frontend document upload interface.
- Frontend interface for providing prompts and generating reports.
- Frontend display of generated reports.
- Frontend display of document processing status (via periodic polling).
- Frontend integration with all relevant backend endpoints.
- Frontend handling of asynchronous tasks (e.g., showing loading states for document processing and using polling for status updates).

## What's Left to Build
- (Fase 4) Advanced Features & Refinements:
    - Report templates.
    - More advanced chunking/embedding strategies.
    - Support for additional document types.
    - UI/UX enhancements.
- (Fase 5) Deployment:
    - Deploying the application to a production environment.
- Testing and bug fixing based on end-to-end testing of the integrated frontend and backend.

## Current Status
Fase 1 (Backend Core & Infrastructure Setup) is complete.
Fase 2 (Document Handling & RAG Pipeline) backend implementation is complete, including the integration of OpenRouter.
Fase 3 (Frontend UI Development) is now complete.
The project is ready for testing and transitioning to Fase 4.

## Known Issues
- None critical preventing the start of testing and Fase 4. Potential future issues may arise during testing or with more complex document types/sizes.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initially planned to use Google Gemini for report generation, but switched to OpenRouter for more flexibility and access to various models.
- Decided to use the OpenAI Python SDK with OpenRouter due to its similarity to the previous Gemini integration approach, simplifying the code change.
- Confirmed that the Supabase RPC `generate_embedding` is a suitable approach for handling embeddings, keeping embedding logic centralized in the database.
- Implemented periodic polling on the frontend to display asynchronous document processing status updates.
